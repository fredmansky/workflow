# Email Notifications
Workflow has a number of email notifications, sent off at different events. Craft provides an easy way to manage these notifications, directly in the control panel, through System Messages. These templates are edited in the control panel, and can be different per site (for multi-site Craft sites). The added bonus is that you can use specific variables in your templates.

Workflow provides example email content as part of the plugin, but you of course can change these to suit your needs.

To access these, visit Utilities â†’ System Messages.
